# Whatsapp-Automation-App
This is a whatsapp based message application which sends the messages to the predefined phone number entered by the user at the respective time set by the user.
The user needs to type the message as well as set the time and submit.Once submitted the timer gets activated and calculates the difference between the present time and time set by the user.
Once the timer gets expired the message is automatically sent to the number defined by the user.
Note:The message will only be sent if the number is registered with whatsapp.
